4.Hydrogen:
the Hydrogen website and forum was offline for the last three months. The problem was caused by security issue with our old hosting platform, which has been taken offline afterwards . The current website is now hosted via Github Pages, minimizing the needed effort for administration and maintenance of the page. Unfortunately, there are no plans at the moment to bring back the forum.
It currently stands to discussion if there will be an official forum again or which alternatives might be available to us.
